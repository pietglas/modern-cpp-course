This repository contains my written programs that are supposed to solve the homework exercises for the course 'Modern C++ for Computer Vision and Image Processing' given in Bonn in 2018. The wegpage with the lectures and the homework can be found here: http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/teaching/modern-cpp/
